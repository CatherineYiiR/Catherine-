        <h2>About French Bulldog</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Potential Genetic Health Issues: The breed has a short nose, which can cause: Brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome (BOAS), restrict oxygen intake, difficulties with panting causing overheating, cleft lip and palates; Cherry eye; Hip dysplasia; Hereditary cataract (early onset) (HC); </li>
        <li>Eye testing in brachycephalic dogs should be routine as a foreshortened head/face can cause substantial welfare problems throughout a dog’s life.</li>
        <li>French Bulldog usually needs a nose surgery to solve the health issues caused by its nose. It is a complicated but necessary surgery for the dog’s basic needs. </li>
        <li>Average Life Span: 11 years</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I have 1 French Bulldog pup for sale, which is a cute girl. The pup’s father had BOAS before having the surgery. Both its parents have done the nose surgery, which I found very necessary for the breed and hope the owner will also give the pup the surgery when it grows up.</p>
        <p>If you are interested in the breed, you should be aware of the health issues caused by its conformation before getting it. Please contact me through the following email address: benaisjfi2@gmail.com </p>
