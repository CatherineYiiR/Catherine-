        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Our family have one male Irish Wolf Hound pup for sale. We are looking for a family that has enough space to keep the dog. If you are interested in the breed, you should be aware that Irish Wolf Hound is a very large breed that needs a lot of exercises every day. Although I don’t know any inherited disease history about the dog’s family, it is a breed with a very short life span. I hope the pup’s new family could spend a lot of time with it and always pay attention to its health condition. If you are interested, please email me at: charliesch1@gmail.com </p>
