        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Only 2 full pedigree boxer pups for sale. They are two boys that will be IKC (Irish Kennel Club) registered. Before purchasing the dogs, you should be aware that pedigree boxers usually have inherited genetic diseases listed above. The pups’ mother displays slight symptoms of hip dysplasia, while the father hasn’t displayed any symptoms of genetic diseases. I cannot confirm that if the pups will have similar problems with their mother, or if they will have any other genetic problems. They will need to have health screenings every year.</p>
        <p>Being a pedigree dog owner, you are responsible for not only your dogs’ health but also the entire Boxer breed. I’m looking for real dog lovers who will spend time with the dogs, and will always follow the breeding regulations. </p>
        <p>The pups’ parents are our family pets and can be seen through videos. If you are interested in the pups, please email me: benja351min@gmail.com</p>
